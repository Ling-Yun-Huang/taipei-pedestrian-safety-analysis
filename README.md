# Taipei Pedestrian Safety Analysis (2020-2022)

A comprehensive analysis of pedestrian safety data in Taipei, completed as part of the **Principles of Data Science** coursework. This project demonstrates strong data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization skills, with actionable insights aimed at improving pedestrian safety.

## Project Overview
This project was part of the **Masterâ€™s in Data Science** at **City, University of London (2024)**, where it was awarded a **Distinction**.

## Key Components
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key patterns and trends in pedestrian accident data.
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Ensuring data integrity for reliable and accurate analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualization**: Applying statistical models and creating impactful visualizations.
- **Storytelling through Data**: Communicating key findings effectively to inform decision-making.

## Goals
- **Identify High-Risk Factors** in pedestrian accidents.
- Demonstrate proficiency in **data manipulation, statistical analysis**, and **data visualization**.
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for improving pedestrian safety in urban environments.

## Key Findings
- **Fatality Risk**: Pedestrian accidents are **ten times more fatal** than the overall average.
- **Risk Factors**: Fatalities are more common in **bus** and **complex accidents**, with **midnight accidents** showing higher risks.
- **Seasonal & Hourly Patterns**: **Winter months** and **afternoon rush hours** have significantly higher accident rates.
- **Age and Severity**: **Older pedestrians** are more likely to experience fatal accidents, and **driver error** is a significant contributing factor.
- **Weather & Road Conditions**: **Slippery roads** and **winter weather** increase accident rates, particularly between **17:00-19:00**.
